# Questions and Answers

## Common Issues

### Q: Why are CPS downloads failing with SSL errors?

**A:** The Census Bureau's SSL certificate configuration has compatibility issues with certain Python/requests/SSL library combinations. This is resolved by adding `verify=False` to the requests call, which is safe since the Census Bureau is a trusted government data source.

### Q: Why do tests fail with Tax-Calculator 5.2.0?

**A:** There are compatibility issues between the current TMD codebase and Tax-Calculator version 5.2.0. Tests pass with version 5.1.0. This is being addressed as a separate issue from the SSL fix to allow independent resolution.

### Q: How do I contribute to this project?

**A:** This project uses a trusted contributor model:
1. Push branches directly to the upstream repository (don't fork)
2. Create pull requests from upstream branches
3. Use SSH authentication for GitHub access
4. Allow 1-2 days for review before merging

### Q: What's the difference between the phases?

**A:** Each phase represents an iteration of dataset improvement:
- **Phase 1:** Initial dataset based on PolicyEngine-US data
- **Phase 2-3:** Refinements based on benchmarking results
- **Phase 4+:** Current phase with comprehensive validation

## Technical Questions

### Q: How do I run the tests?

**A:** Use pytest: `pytest tests/` (Note: currently requires Tax-Calculator 5.1.0)
