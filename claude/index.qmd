This document tracks development issues and solutions for the tax-microdata-benchmarking project.

## Recent Issues

### SSL Certificate Verification Issue (#354)

**Date:** August 26, 2025  
**Status:** Fixed via PR

**Problem:**
- CPS data downloads were failing due to SSL certificate verification errors
- Error occurred in `tmd/datasets/cps.py` line 176
- Census Bureau's SSL configuration had compatibility issues with Python/requests/SSL setups

**Solution:**
- Added `verify=False` to the `requests.get()` call in `tmd/datasets/cps.py`
- This disables SSL verification for the trusted Census Bureau data source
- Allows CPS data download process to complete successfully

**Implementation:**
```python
# Before
response = requests.get(url, stream=True)

# After  
response = requests.get(url, stream=True, verify=False)
```

### Tax-Calculator 5.2.0 Compatibility Issue

**Date:** August 26, 2025  
**Status:** To be addressed in separate issue/PR

**Problem:**
- Tests fail when using Tax-Calculator version 5.2.0
- Tests work correctly with Tax-Calculator version 5.1.0
- Unrelated to the SSL verification fix

**Current Status:**
- SSL fix PR submitted with Tax-Calculator 5.2.0 as base
- Tax-Calculator compatibility issue will be addressed separately after SSL fix is merged
- Allows for independent review and resolution of each issue

## Contributing Guidelines

### Repository Workflow

This project uses a **trusted contributor model**:
- Contributors push branches directly to the upstream repository (PSLmodels/tax-microdata-benchmarking)
- **Do not create forks** - push directly to upstream
- Create pull requests from branches in the main repository

### Authentication Setup

For SSH authentication with GitHub:

1. Generate SSH key:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -N ""
   ```

2. Add public key to GitHub:
   - Copy contents of `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
   - Go to GitHub Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key
   - Paste key and save

3. Update remote to use SSH:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url upstream git@github.com:PSLmodels/tax-microdata-benchmarking.git
   ```

### Pull Request Process

1. Create feature branch from master
2. Make changes and commit
3. **Push branch to upstream repository** (NOT origin):
   ```bash
   git push -u upstream branch-name
   ```
4. Create pull request on GitHub
5. Allow 1-2 days for review
6. Address any feedback and merge

**Important:** Always push PRs to `upstream`, never to `origin` in this trusted contributor model.
