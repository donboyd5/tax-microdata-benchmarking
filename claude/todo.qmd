# ToDo

## Completed Work (2025-09-02)

### Quarto Project Update for 2021 Potential Targets
- Updated the quarto project configuration so that `quarto render` now properly reproduces the 2021 potential targets
- All quarto files and configurations are working correctly for target generation
- Current branch `create-national-target-folder-structure` contains the completed work

### Next Steps
- ✅ Create national_targets folder structure for PR (excluding _book/ and _freeze/ directories)
- ✅ Prepare branch for upstream push to create PR (branch: `national-targets-pr`)

### Important Workflow Reminder
This project uses a **trusted contributor model** - always push PRs to `upstream`, not `origin`:
```bash
git push -u upstream national-targets-pr
```
