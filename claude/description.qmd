# Project Description

## Tax Microdata Benchmarking

This repository develops a general-purpose validated microdata file for use in tax microsimulation models, specifically:

- [PolicyEngine-US](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-us)
- [Tax-Calculator](https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator)

## Development Phases

The project progresses through multiple phases of refinement:

1. **Phase 1:** Base dataset from PolicyEngine-US PUF-enhanced CPS data
2. **Phase 2-3:** Iterative improvements and validation
3. **Phase 4+/6:** Current phase (version 1.0.0 released March 2025)

## Key Components

### Data Sources
- Licensed 2015 PUF data from IRS/SOI
- Current Population Survey (CPS) data from Census Bureau
- Various targeting data for validation

### Outputs
- Three TMD CSV files for Tax-Calculator usage
- Comprehensive benchmarking results
- Sub-national area weights for geographic analysis

### Validation
- Extensive comparison with federal agency estimates
- Testing against CBO, JCT, and Treasury projections
- Multi-year validation (2023, 2026)

## Technical Infrastructure

- Python-based data processing pipeline
- Comprehensive testing framework with pytest
- Quarto-based documentation system
- Git-based version control with trusted contributor model
