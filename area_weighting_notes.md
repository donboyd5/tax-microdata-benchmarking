# Session Notes: Area weighting

---


## Goals

- Extend area data used to create area weights for states and for Congressional districts to 2022; we already have 2021
- Make the process of developing area targets and mapping them to TMD variables smoother and cleaner
- Ensure that either 2021 or 2022 data can be used to estimate each area's share of national data for specific income and other items: 2021 data shares can be used for any national data year, 2022 area data shares can be used for any national data year, and so on. In practice, we'll almost always pair 2021 area data with 2021 national data and 2022 area data with 2022 national data. But the flexibility to use different years is important.
- Make sure we can reproduce files created under the old process with files under the new process
- Make the area weighting optimization considerably faster. Consider converting the objective function to minimizing change from average national weights, subject to constraints, much as we did with national reweighting. This could involve using the Clarabel solver.
- Look for ways to create area weights en masse efficiently -- all 50 states, or all 435 Congressional districts - perhaps benefiting from solver features and also paralellism
- Convert the data preparation from R to python

## Key Design Principles

### A. All targets as shares (eventual goal)
Area targets = national TMD total × (area SOI / national SOI).
SOI provides geographic distribution, TMD provides levels.
Shares computed at variable × AGI-bin × filing-status granularity.
Transition: reproduce R pipeline first, then convert all to shares.

### B. Optimization variable: deviation from population-proportional
x_i = area_weight / (pop_share × national_weight).
x_i = 1 means population-proportional share.
QP minimizes sum((x_i - 1)²) subject to target bounds.

## Progress

### Completed

**Phase 1: Module structure and constants** (2026-03-12)
- Created `tmd/areas/prepare/` package with `__init__.py` and `constants.py`
- Constants: AreaType enum, AGI cuts (10 state bins, 9 CD bins), SOI file patterns (2015-2022), SHARING_MAPPINGS, STATE_INFO, ALLCOUNT_VARS

**Phase 2: Clarabel area weight optimizer** (2026-03-12)
- Created `tmd/areas/create_area_weights_clarabel.py` (~620 lines)
- Constrained QP mirroring national reweighting: minimize sum((x_i-1)²) with elastic slack
- Default params: tolerance=0.004, multiplier bounds [0.0, 100.0], slack penalty=1e6
- Bridge flag `USE_CLARABEL = True` in `create_area_weights.py`
- Performance on "xx" area: Clarabel ~9s (all 16 targets hit), L-BFGS-B ~7.5s (1 target miss)
- All 50 existing tests pass

**Phase 3: State SOI data ingestion** (2026-03-12)
- Created `tmd/areas/prepare/soi_state_data.py` — reads raw SOI CSVs, pivots to long format, classifies variables, creates derived vars (18400 = 18425 + 18450), scales amounts ×1000, adds AGI labels, produces base_targets
- Created `tmd/areas/prepare/census_population.py` — embedded 2021 Census PEP population data for all 53 areas (50 states + DC + PR + US), with fallback to user-supplied CSV
- Tested: 8 years (2015-2022) loaded, ~98K rows per year, all 54 areas (incl OA), verified NY values

**Phase 4: Target file writer** (2026-03-12)
- Created `tmd/areas/prepare/target_file_writer.py` — JSON recipe parser (strips // comments), variable mapping loader, match frame builder, per-area CSV writer
- Produces output matching format expected by `create_area_weights.py`: varname,count,scope,agilo,agihi,fstatus,target
- Tested: generates 144-147 targets per state across all 53 areas

**Phase 6a: Target sharing pipeline** (2026-03-12)
- Created `tmd/areas/prepare/target_sharing.py` — computes TMD national sums by AGI bin, SOI geographic shares, derives area targets = TMD_sum × SOI_share
- 4 shared variables: e01500←01700, e02400←02500, e18400←18400, e18500←18500
- `build_enhanced_targets()` combines base + shared targets with sort ordering
- Full pipeline tested end-to-end: SOI → base_targets → enhanced_targets → target files for all 53 areas

### In Progress / Upcoming

- **Phase 5**: CD SOI data ingestion (zip files, 9 AGI stubs, Congress crosswalk)
- **Phase 6b**: Convert ALL targets to share-based (not just 4 vars)
- **Phase 7**: 2022 data extension
- **Phase 8**: Flexible year pairing (area data year ≠ national data year)
- **Phase 9**: Batch processing — parallel optimization for all states/CDs, warm starts, GPU support
- **Phase 10**: Full validation

## Branch

All work is on the `area-weighting-overhaul` branch. Push only to `origin` (donboyd5 fork).

## Files Created/Modified

New files:
- `tmd/areas/prepare/__init__.py`
- `tmd/areas/prepare/constants.py`
- `tmd/areas/prepare/census_population.py`
- `tmd/areas/prepare/soi_state_data.py`
- `tmd/areas/prepare/target_file_writer.py`
- `tmd/areas/prepare/target_sharing.py`
- `tmd/areas/create_area_weights_clarabel.py`

Modified files:
- `tmd/areas/create_area_weights.py` (added USE_CLARABEL bridge)

## Open Items

- Verify 2022 SOI CSV file format matches 2021 (column names, AGI stubs)
- 2022 Census population data needed (not yet embedded)
- Decide on Clarabel multiplier bounds for area weights (currently [0.0, 100.0])
- Batch processing strategy: ProcessPoolExecutor, warm starts, GPU acceleration
- Consider maintaining one large DataFrame for all areas rather than per-area file I/O during optimization
